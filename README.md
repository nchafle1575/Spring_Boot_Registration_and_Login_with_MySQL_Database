# Spring_Boot_Registration_and_Login_with_MySQL_Database
this is basic login and registration page using Springboot mySql and Thymeleaf and also HTML 5 and Bootstrap 4 for responsive user interface JUnit 5 and AssertJ for unit testing
Through this Spring Boot tutorial, I’d love to guide you to develop a Java web application from scratch with the essential features: user registration, login, logout and view users list – with user information stored in MySQL database. You will go through the process of coding a Spring Boot project using the following technologies:
# Spring Web MVC for the web layer
# Spring Data JPA with Hibernate framework or the data access layer
# Spring Security for authentication, login and logout
# Thymeleaf as template engine
# HTML 5 and Bootstrap 4 for responsive user interface
# JUnit 5 and AssertJ for unit testing
# MySQL database

and please change mysql username and pwd as per your system and create database login, no need to build table and 

mysql> use login;
Database changed
mysql> show tables;
